****Project Title: ** Singapore Resale Flat Price Prediction**

**Skills Gained:**

**1. Data Wrangling:** Handling and cleaning resale flat transaction data from Singapore HDB.
**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding data distributions and relationships between features.
**3. Model Building:** Selecting and training regression models like linear regression, decision trees, or random forests.
**4. Model Deployment:** Building a user-friendly web app using Streamlit and deploying it on platforms like Render.

**Domain:** Real Estate

**Problem Statement:**

Develop a machine learning model and web app to predict resale flat prices in Singapore, aiding buyers and sellers in estimating property values accurately.
**
Motivation:**

The competitive nature of Singapore's resale flat market demands accurate pricing estimates. By considering factors like location, flat type, and lease duration, a predictive model can provide invaluable insights to users.

**Scope:**

**1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Gather and clean resale flat transaction data from Singapore HDB.
**2. Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features like town, flat type, floor area, etc., and create additional features for better prediction accuracy.
**3. Model Selection and Training**: Choose and train regression models on historical data.
**4. Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance using metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R2 Score.
**5. Streamlit Web Application:** Develop a user-friendly web app allowing users to input flat details for price prediction.
**6. Deployment on Render**: Deploy the Streamlit app on Render for accessibility.
**7. Testing and Validation:** Ensure the app functions correctly and provides accurate predictions.

**Deliverables:**

1. Well-trained ML model for resale price prediction.
2. User-friendly web app deployed on Render.
3. Documentation and usage instructions.
4. Project report summarizing analysis, model development, and deployment.
   
**Results:**
The project benefits both buyers and sellers, providing them with valuable pricing insights. It showcases the practical application of ML in real estate and web development.
