# Singapore Resale Flat Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model and deploy it as a user-friendly web application to predict the resale prices of flats in Singapore. By leveraging historical data of resale flat transactions and utilizing machine learning techniques, the project seeks to assist both potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat accurately.

## Motivation
The resale flat market in Singapore is highly competitive, making it challenging to accurately estimate the resale value of a flat. This project aims to overcome these challenges by providing users with estimated resale prices based on various factors such as location, flat type, floor area, and lease duration.
