Project Title: Singapore Resale Flat Price Prediction

Skills Gained:

Data Wrangling: Handling and cleaning resale flat transaction data from Singapore HDB.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data distributions and relationships between features.
Model Building: Selecting and training regression models like linear regression, decision trees, or random forests.
Model Deployment: Building a user-friendly web app using Streamlit and deploying it on platforms like Render.
Domain: Real Estate

Problem Statement:
Develop a machine learning model and web app to predict resale flat prices in Singapore, aiding buyers and sellers in estimating property values accurately.

Motivation:
The competitive nature of Singapore's resale flat market demands accurate pricing estimates. By considering factors like location, flat type, and lease duration, a predictive model can provide invaluable insights to users.

Scope:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather and clean resale flat transaction data from Singapore HDB.
Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features like town, flat type, floor area, etc., and create additional features for better prediction accuracy.
Model Selection and Training: Choose and train regression models on historical data.
Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R2 Score.
Streamlit Web Application: Develop a user-friendly web app allowing users to input flat details for price prediction.
Deployment on Render: Deploy the Streamlit app on Render for accessibility.
Testing and Validation: Ensure the app functions correctly and provides accurate predictions.
Deliverables:

Well-trained ML model for resale price prediction.
User-friendly web app deployed on Render.
Documentation and usage instructions.
Project report summarizing analysis, model development, and deployment.
Results:
The project benefits both buyers and sellers, providing them with valuable pricing insights. It showcases the practical application of ML in real estate and web development.
